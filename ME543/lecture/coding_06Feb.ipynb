    "Consider the boundary value problem (BVP) consisting of the differential equation $$\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} +x \\frac{dy}{dx} + \\beta y = 0$$\n",
    "with boundary conditions $$y'(0)=0, \\; y(1)=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "0) Classify the equation before doing any computing. Can you write an analytical solution for this equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Linearity let's us choose $y(0)=1$__ to go along with $y'(0)=0$ for initial conditions (ICs).\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Use an ODE solver to compute solutions for a few values of $\\beta$. Plot your results and inspect to get a feel for how the solution behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the first 4 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in 3 different ways:\n",

    "2a) Use an ODE solver to compute solutions for a few values of $\\beta$. Plot your results and inspect to get a feel for how the solutions behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "2b) Use the shooting method based on your Runge-Kutta code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2c) Use the shooting method based on the `ivp_solve` library function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Use the direct solve method with an eigensolver from the linear algebra library.\n",

    "If you breezed through the items above, try this one:\n",

    "4b) Consider the ODE $$\\frac{d}{dx} \\big[ (1-x^2) \\frac{dy}{dx} \\big] + \\lambda y = 0$$ with boundary conditions $$y'(0)=0, y(1)=0$$"
