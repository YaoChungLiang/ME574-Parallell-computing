    "This course aims to provide a significant hands-on computing experience focused on harnessing the power of the modern graphics processing unit (GPU) and applying that computing power to applications useful to engineers: computing and visualizing functions, computing derivatives and integrals, solving differential equations, etc. If you have a \"gaming\" laptop with a recent vintage CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU, you are actually in possession of a system that would have qualified as a supercomputer not so many years ago, and you will learn how to use that laptop in \"supercomputer\" mode in this course. If you do not have access to your own system with suitable hardware, you are NOT left out:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can develop your parallel code in \"simulation mode\" where your central processing unit (CPU) does a serial imitation of what your GPU would do in parellel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We will be part of a pilot project to test out cloud-based GPU computing capabilities. Please look for details about this in the not too distant future. We will need to use this resource responsibly to get the best \"bang for the buck\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For a bit more detail, here is the official course description:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Utilization of GPU-based parallel computing for engineering applications. Basics of hardware and software for GPU-based parallel computing. Introduction to GPU programming, language extensions, and interfaces. Introduction to parallel methods for numerical analysis and digital design. Applications in imaging, inspection, and computer-aided design. Hands-on experience creating GPU-powered parallel applications. Prerequisite: Introductory computing; graduate standing or permission of instructor; recommended: Some introductory computing experience and graduate standing in engineering"
