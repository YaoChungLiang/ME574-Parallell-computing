    "# ME574 Homework 2 <br>Due Friday April 17\n",
    "\n",
    "___Your \"deliverable\" to be turned in is a python file (with a `.py` extension) that you create by filling in the template file (`template_hw2.py`) that is posted on the Canvas site along with the homework assignment.___\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the notebook \"Ch. 2 - Function Evaluation and the Map App\" then do the following problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Explore numba's capabilities as described in the documentation section \"Device detection and enquiry\". \n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Write and execute code to get numba to print information about your GPU including the model number, compute capability, and amount of available memory. (Include your code in the template and copy/paste the info  you obtain about your device as comments.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) Estimate (by hand calculation) the number of 64-bit floats you can store on your GPU based on your result from Problem#1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  Modify the parallel version of the _map_ app to use arrays of 64-bit floats, and experiment with running the modified code for different array sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) How many 64-bit floats were in the largest array you could run successfully?\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) What error message was generated if you requested a larger array?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Consider the code included in the python_logistic_map notebook that computes the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Locate the `for` loops in the logistic map code. What quantity is iterated over in each loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) For which loop are the computations in each iteration independent of one another? Briefly explain the reasoning behind your response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) Implement a parallel version of the code to compute the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map.\n",
    "\n",
    "    d) Modify both the serial and parallel codes to print the time required to perform the computation. Determine the time requried to compute 1000 iterations for 1000 parameter values, and report the \"acceleration\" factor; i.e. the ratio of serial run time over parallel run time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) In Homework#1 you created serial code to compute the Mandelbrot set. Now consider creating a parallel  version. \n",
    "\n",
    "    a) What do the `for` loops in the serial code iterate over? For which loops are the computations for each iteration independent of one another? Briefly explain the reasoning behind your reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) Write a numba implementation that a lunches a 2D computational grid to parallelize the appropriate loops. Run your parallel code and verify that it reproduces the results of the serial version. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Also run your code to answer the questions below:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c) What is the finest resolution 2D grid can you run on your GPU? What error message is generated by attempting finer grid resolution?\n",
    "\n",
    "    d) What is the largest square block that you can run on your GPU? What error message is generated if you request more threads in each block?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
